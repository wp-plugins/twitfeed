*******************
*  Instructions   *
*******************

Requirements:

	o ) Memcache + php5-memcache
	o ) php5-curl
	o ) Phirehose (included, with some minor changes )
        o ) jQuery must be included in your blog

Installation:

Just uncompress to your plugins folder and make sure the requirements are met.
In the wp admin menu enable TwitFeed, and set the options for your account.

You WILL need to change some options in the daemon and consumer scripts.
There are four settings with need to change in BOTH scripts:

	o ) appRunAsGID (default 1000)
		o ) This is the group id the daemon will run under. Set to a valid group id.
    	o ) appRunAsUID (default 1000)
		o ) Similar to above, user id instead of group. Set to a valid user id.
	o ) logLocation (default /var/log/{OPTIONS.appName}.log)
		o ) Where the log will be written.
		o ) The user above must be able to create a file here, and write to the file.
	o ) appPidLocation (default /var/run/[daemon]/[daemon].pid)
		o ) Process id tracking file
		o ) User must be able to create and write to files here.

Running:

From a shell run: 
	./daemon
	./consumer

The daemon script connects to twitter and stores tweets in memcache.
The consumer script reads the data from memcache and inserts into the db.

This is a two step process in order to make sure than the daemon does not
fall behind if the feed and database are busy.

If you want to write an init script you can do:
	./daemon --write-initd
	./consumer --write-initd

This will create scripts in /etc/init.d which you can use to start and stop 
the daemons. You can also create startup scripts so the daemons start if
you reboot, but I won't get in to that. Look up the details on the PEAR
System_Daemon class if you wish to do this. Also, this only works for
Debian and Ubuntu based systems as far as I can tell.
